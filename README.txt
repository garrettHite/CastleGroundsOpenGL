This is a recreation of the opening level in Super Mario 64 called Castle Grounds.
I really wanted to make this level because I grew up playing Mario 64 and Castle
Grounds is a very iconic part of that game.

I think I did a pretty good job at recreating the level. I tried to put in as much
detail as I was able to. I am pretty proud of my tri and quad functions. These
functions act as a replacement for the GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP and GL_QUAD_STRIP functions.
My new functions take an array of vertices and creates the shapes I want while
also calculating the proper surface normals and applying textures.
I am also pretty proud of the result of the project. Being that I was going for
specific details at specific locations I ended up drawing a map of all of the
vertices in the scene on a large piece of graph paper which I then converted to
multiple arrays of vertices in the program.
Overall, I am very happy with the result. I think this project gave me some good
insight into how geometry in video games could be generated.

The algorithm for calculating surface normals used in the tri and quad functions
is from ex13.
The textures were ripped by Booscaster. The original texture sheet is in the
Final Project folder titled "Super Mario 64 - Castle Grounds Textures.png".
The Sky box was pulled from Google. I do not know the author of the work.
